This plugin automatically creates parent directories for the current file if they don't exist yet.


Example:
    If you're currently in an empty directory, without the plugin, the command
        :w foo/bar/baz.txt
    will fail with with E212 ("Can't open file for writing.")

    The plugin will automatically create the directories foo/ and foo/bar/ for you before Vim saves 
    the file, so you don't have to remember to do it manually.
